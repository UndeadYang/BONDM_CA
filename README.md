## Background

*    This project is built for the Parallel Growth edition of BONDM(A bio-inspired optimal network division method, submitted to Physica A, Elsevier). 

*    This name of the paper has been determined as 'Network Division Method Based on Cellular Growth and Physarum-inspired Network Adaptation.', for some reason, the project name remains as 'CPGBNDM'.

*    This paper has been accepted by International Journal of Unconventional Computing(IJUC) and will be public soon.

## Run the algorithm

1.  Clone the project and change your matlab path to it.
2.  Enter 'run' to run the run.m file.
3.  Subnetwork examples will be shown after the algorithm finished.

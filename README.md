## Background

This project is bult for the cellular automata edition of BONDM(A Bio-inspird Network Dividing Method). 
This algorithm is much faster and stabler than the original BONDM with a better result.
The name of this modified algorithm's paper is not been decided, and I have no idea which journel to submit.

## Run the algorithm

Clone the project and change your matlab path to it.
Type 'run' to run the run.m file.
3 subnetwork examples will be shown after the algorithm finish.

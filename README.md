## Background

*    This project is built for the Parallel Growth edition of BONDM(A bio-inspired optimal network division method, submitted to Physica A, Elseviser). 

*    This name of the paper has been determined as 'Cellular Parallel Growth Based Network Divding Method', in the same way, the project name was altered as 'CPGBNDM'.

*    This paper will be submitted to AMM or other Elseviser journal.

## Run the algorithm

1.  Clone the project and change your matlab path to it.
2.  Type 'run' to run the run.m file.
3.  Subnetwork examples will be shown after the algorithm finish.
